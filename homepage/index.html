            <h2>Welcome to Local Wildlife Tracker</h2>
            <p>
                Wildlife Tracker is designed to empower communities to monitor, protect, and restore local forests and wildlife habitats.
                By providing tools to report sightings, track habitat health, and document deforestation or environmental damage, our platform encourages proactive conservation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goals are to increase awareness of local biodiversity, foster citizen science participation, and educate the public about the crucial role of forests in urban areas.
                Whether you’re a student, volunteer, or concerned neighbor, Wildlife Tracker provides the information and support needed to make informed decisions that protect ecosystems.

            <h2>Threats to Wildlife & Local Forests</h2>
            <p>
                Urban wildlife and forests in London face numerous pressures. Habitat loss from construction and urban sprawl reduces the areas where animals can live, feed, and breed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pollution from traffic, waste, and industrial activities contaminates soil, air, and water, directly impacting local flora and fauna.
            </p>
            <p>
                Invasive species compete with native plants and animals, altering natural ecosystems and sometimes causing local extinctions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Human activities such as cutting hedgerows, removing trees, or encroaching on green spaces can fragment habitats, making it harder for wildlife to survive.

        <h2>Why Deforestation Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Forests are vital for life on Earth — absorbing carbon dioxide, providing habitat for millions of species, and supporting livelihoods.
            Every year, millions of hectares are lost due to logging, agriculture, and urban expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deforestation accelerates climate change, disrupts ecosystems, and threatens countless species with extinction.
            Protecting forests ensures clean air, fresh water, and a stable planet for future generations.

        <h2>Deforestation in London</h2>
        <p>
            Even in urban areas like London, trees and green spaces are under pressure from development and human activity.
            Local forests and parks are home to hundreds of species of plants and animals, including foxes, hedgehogs, and various birds.
