            <h2>Threats to Wildlife</h2>
            <p>
              Wildlife face numerous challenges. Habitat loss from construction, pollution, and traffic reduces the space animals need to feed, breed, and thrive.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Pollution from traffic, waste, and industrial activities harms local wildlife by contaminating the air they breate, the water they drink and the habitats they are dependant on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Human activities such as cutting hedgerows, removing trees, or encroaching on green spaces can fragment habitats, making it harder for wildlife to survive.

        <h2>Why Animal Wildlife Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Animals are essential to healthy ecosystems. They can help control pests, pollinate plants, disperse seeds and maintain the balance of nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Protecting animal populations ensures biodiversity, strenghtens resilience against environmental changes, and keeps urban and rural ecosystems functioning properly.
            Every species, no matter how small, plays a critical role this makes it crucial for the communities to raise awareness as animals play a vital role to sustain a healthy ecosystem.
